# Research + Operations Handbook
This repository brings together work the Department of Agriculture, Water, and the Environment had done internally since around 2017. We have used the 18F Methods that were generously added to the public domain by the US government to help inform our work, and we acknowledge and give thanks to our American public service collegues for their work in making this available in the public domain. The 18F Methods were created to describe how 18F puts human-centered design into practice. Both the 18F Methods and our departmental handbook was developed primarily as an internal resource, we hope it can help everyone adopt the methods of human-centered design.
We hope also, that this helps to contribute to the global voice around research operations, the mechanisms and processes that set user research in motion. Incorporating research operations into the handbook is a deliberate act by the department as we work to utilise an emergent practice to help sclae the impact of the research we do. We hope surfacing the practice of research operations as a central part of the practice of human centred design will assist others as they seek to scale the impact of the work they do. 

## Why a Research + Operations Handbook?
In order to function well within cross-functional teams, researchers and designers need to know a few things: which research methods they might choose from, why one particular method makes more sense than another at any given moment, and, once they’ve picked a method, how to actually execute it, including the operations of doing so. This handbook collects this essential information as a series of cards and a list of templates for expert users. In practice, we’ve found the Handbook can provide folks with a gateway into our work and build internal alignment around a shared vocabulary.

### Specific to the Department of Agriculture, Water, and the Environment, specific to the federal government
It’s important to note that the Research + Operations Handbook is designed to account for two things that may not otherwise concern a more generic collection of design methods. First, this information directly reflects and supports the department's human-centered work. (They are also continuously updated in a human-centered way — how meta!) Second, the Research + Operations Handbook is designed to keep Australian Public Servants on the happy side of the law. This collection specifically includes helpful information on topics for which designers working in the federal government may need clarification, such as privacy, records management, and the various Acts that underpin research data management in government, such as the Privacy Act (1988) and the Public Service Act (1999.)

### Running the Research and Operations Handbook website on your local machine:
This repository is currently forked from the 18F Methods repo. Therefore the information to follow comes from the 18F Methods repo:

You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) ( > version 2.1.5 ). You may consider using a Ruby version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to help ensure that Ruby version upgrades don’t mean all your [gems](https://rubygems.org/) will need to be rebuilt.

On OS X, you can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Ruby in `/usr/local/bin`, which may require you to update your `$PATH` environment variable:

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install ruby
```

To serve 18F Methods locally, using `methods` as the name of your new repository:
Run each of the following steps to get the site up and running.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:18F/methods
$ cd methods
$ bundle install
$ jekyll serve
```

You should be able to see the site at: `http://localhost:4000/`
