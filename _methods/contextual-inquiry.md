## How to do it

1. With permission from a supervisor and from the participant, schedule a time to watch a typical work activity and record data.
1. While observing, ask the participant to act normally. Pretend you're a student learning how to do the job. Ask questions to help you understand what the person is doing and why.
1. At the end of the session, explain what you have learned and check for errors.
1. Immediately after, write up your notes.
