what: A quick way to find common, large usability problems on a website.
why: To quickly identify common design problems that make websites hard to use without conducting more involved user research.
timeRequired: 1â€“2 hours

## How to do it

1. Recruit a group of three to five people familiar with evaluation methods. These people are not necessarily designers, but are familiar with common usability best practices. They are usually not users.
1. Ask each person to individually create a list of "heuristics" or general usability best practices. Examples of heuristics from Nielsen's "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" include:
    1.  The website should keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
    1.  The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.
    1. Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.
1. Ask each person to evaluate the website against their list and write down possible problems.
1. After individual evaluations, gather people to discuss what they found and prioritize potential problems.
