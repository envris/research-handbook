## How to do it

  1. Familiarize yourself with the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Guidelines, the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and the Privacy Act 1988.
  1. Consult your organization's privacy office if you plan to substantially make use of information that could potentially identify specific individuals.
  1. Inform and collect the voluntary consent of anyone who participates in moderated design research. Ensure that all unmoderated forms of research (for example, web analytics) are covered by an easy-to-access privacy policy.
  1. Pay special attention to all categories of information used throughout the design process. Note contexts in which it's not okay to share certain categories of information.
